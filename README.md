# Weather-Dashboard-Server-Side-Api

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
    
    <!--I found a couple of examples, and implemented some of their strategies.  
        Primarily with the html and js. Helped a lot, but still confusing.
            Also, I probably have too many scripts...but it works, so I'm not  
                touching it-->
